Mark's feedback:

Hi AJ, please revisit this when you get a chance to finish it up - at this point I suggest getting one function of the required ones working. I understand your time constraints and wish you get the most of this program - please reach out when you would like assistance and let us know how we can help out.

Coding comes with practice - it is ok to get things wrong at first - this is the time for it while you are learning - but getting your hands into things really helps with gaining momentum.

Reference activity solutions from unit 8 - there are examples of:

taking in arguments through the command line
case switch statements (conditionals)
api calls with axios
