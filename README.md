# Objective
Liri, a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface, aims to empower users to access information about a given song, movie or band through the ease of an intuitive Command Line Interface application.


# Problem Solved
Liri eliminates the inconvenience of interacting with multiple apps in order to retrieve pop culture-related data; facts about movies, musical artists, and songs can be accessed in one place.


# Organization
The code bringing Liri's functionality to life can all almost entirely be found in one JavaScript file, liri.js. A .env file, .gitignore file, and key.js file allow for protection of sensitive information.


# Technologies and Tools Used
NPM packages and axios calls to APIs in combination with node.js make Liri come to life. These include:
- Node-Spotify-API
- Axios
- OMDB API and the 
- Bands In Town API
- DotEnv


# How-to
To use Liri, the user must do the following:
1. Navigate to the appropriate directory in terminal, that which is housing liri.js and the accompanying files necessary to run the app. Entire directory can be obtained via Github repo at https://github.com/ajmacdo/liri-node-app 
2. Type "node liri.js" in terminal, hit enter.
3. Use keyboard arrow buttons in order to select from the menu which functionality is desired; movie-this for movie data, concert-this for musical artist data, or spotify-this-song for data on a specific song.
